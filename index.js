  /* Great Job! But we want to see not only 20 characters, we want all of them! So 
  lets implement the pagination.

By adding the string ?page=<pageIndex> to the end of the fetch URL, you can receive 
the respective page of characters.
Use here the state variable page to keep track of the current page index.
Inside of the info part of the received data you can find the max page count.
Add an event listener on each of the next and prev buttons which do the following
it is prevented that the page index could go higher than the max page index or below 1
the page index is increased / decreased
the fetchCharacters function is called
Update the pagination display each time characters are fetched to show the 
current page index and the current max page index.*/

}

fetchCharacter();

// Adding event listner for the buttons.

prevButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
 if(page > 1) {
  page--;
  fetchCharacter(); 
}

 if (page < maxPage) {
  page++;
  fetchCharacter();
 }

/*The Search Bar
Now we want even more functionality in our app. We want to find individual 
characters by typing their name into the search bar.

Create a 'submit' event listener on the search bar.
Update the state variable searchQuery with the current text inside the search bar 
every time this event is triggered.
Modify the fetch URL again by adding another url encoded attribute name: append 
&name=<searchQuery> to the url. If the search query is an empty string, it will be
 ignored by the API, so don't worry about that.
Now trigger the function fetchCharacters whenever a submit event happens.
ðŸ’¡ You might run into some bugs at this point. Think about how the page and max page 
index might have to change when you start searching for only subsets of all characters. */

searchBar.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
event.preventDefault();
searchQuery = searchBar.target.query.value.trim();
page = 1;
fetchCharacter();
